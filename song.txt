I'm in the moment
Tell me what you wanna do
We let it snow
Enjoy the mountain view
Like superheroes, we catch the stars and moon

[Chorus]
We got this one last night with our hands up high
Make me feel alive when my mind's enslaved for you
(Not looking for love, just looking for you, ooh)
I got this one last one night, I got nothing to hide
Baby, don't be shy, cause my kiss won't lie to you
(Not looking for love, I'm looking for you, ooh)

[Verse 2]
I wear sunglasses all through the night
Our skin is glowing from the red traffic light
And if you feel me let our bodies collide
I wanna dive in your California High
See upcoming pop shows
Get tickets for your favorite artists

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in the moment
Tell me what you wanna do
We let it snow
Enjoy the mountain view
Like superheroes, we catch the stars and moon

[Chorus]
We got this one last night with our hands up high
Make me feel alive when my mind's enslaved for you
(Not looking for love, just looking for you, ooh)
I got this one last one night, I got nothing to hide
Baby, don't be shy, cause my kiss won't lie to you
(Not looking for love, I'm looking for you, ooh)
[Bridge]
Hey, get me high
Hey, get me high
Hey (I got this one last time)
Get me high (I got nothing to hide)
Hey (Baby don't be shy)
Get me high
Because my kiss won't lie to you

(I got this one last one night, I got nothing to hide
Baby, don't be shy, cause my kiss won't lie to you
Not looking for love, I'm looking for you, ooh)
